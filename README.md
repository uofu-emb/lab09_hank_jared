## Invariants
1. With your partner, write down a set of invariants your system should have, with a specific emphasis on safety invariants.
1. You should be able to identify specific invariant conditions, that if violated, represent a unsafe condition or safety hazard.
1. Also consider invariants that are assumptions made about the environment or the scenario.
1. Write your invariants in the form a logical predicate, i.e. a statement that must be true.
